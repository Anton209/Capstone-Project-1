        <h2>Career Objective</h2>
        <hr />
        <p>Driven and accomplished, with a background in Nursing and Hospitality, seeking to leverage a diverse skill set and academic background to pursue a rewarding career in Psychiatric Nursing, with a heavy interest in helping and supporting people. Born and raised in Papua New Guinea, I embarked on a journey of academic excellence at Toowoomba Grammar School, where I honed my leadership and academic skills as a boarder, graduating in 2023. Complementing my education, I obtained a Certificate II in Hospitality with Smart Skill, showcasing my commitment to personal development and furthering my career opportunities.

            I previously pursued a Nursing Degree at the University of the Sunshine Coast but am no longer a student there due to personal reasons. I have cultivated strong attention to detail and organizational skills through my personal life and academic experiences. Developing my suitability for the hospitality environment, I have obtained a Responsible Service of Alcohol Certificate.
            
            As I continue to explore opportunities, I am eager to apply my skills, knowledge, and passion to contribute effectively in the health field. With a dedication to continuous learning and growth, I am poised to make a meaningful impact in the world of health and in people’s lives.</p>
