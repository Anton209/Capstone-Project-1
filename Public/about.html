    <h2>About Me:</h2>
    <p>Hello! I'm Anthony Lyons, originally from East New Britain Province in Papua New Guinea. I have Papua New Guinean and English heritage, which has given me a rich multicultural perspective.</p>
    
    <p>I spent most of my junior school years in Rabaul before moving to Australia to attend Toowoomba Grammar School as a boarding student. During this time, I actively participated in sports such as volleyball, soccer, and rugby, which helped me develop teamwork, discipline, and leadership skills.</p>
    
    <p>After high school, I studied nursing at the University of Sunshine Coast for a year. Although I found the subject interesting, I realized it wasn't the right fit for me and decided to return home to assist with my family's company. This experience has strengthened my work ethic and sense of community.</p>
    
    <p>In addition to my academic and work experiences, I volunteered at Sony Camp, caring for children with special needs. This taught me patience, compassion, and the importance of giving back.</p>
    
    <p>I'm passionate about personal growth, helping others, and making a positive impact in my community. Looking ahead, I aim to continue developing my skills and exploring new opportunities that align with my values and interests.</p>
